<h2>Introduction:</h2> 
  <div id="khan">
        <p>Stock price prediction is a complex and challenging task that involves analyzing historical data, market trends, and various influencing factors to forecast the future movement of stock prices. It encompasses a wide range of techniques, including statistical models, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence. These methods aim to uncover patterns and correlations in the data, identify key indicators and market signals, and make predictions based on these insights. However, it is important to note that stock price prediction is inherently uncertain due to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of financial markets. While advanced technologies and sophisticated models have improved prediction accuracy to some extent, there is still a degree of unpredictability and risk involved in forecasting stock prices. It is crucial for investors and analysts to approach stock price predictions with caution, considering them as valuable tools for decision-making rather than infallible sources of future outcomes.</p>
